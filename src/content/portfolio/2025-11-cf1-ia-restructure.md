Led initiative to unify the Cloudflare One (Cloudflare's Zero Trust solution) documentation with the dashboard product experience. Orchestrated a seven-person writing team to execute a data-driven IA strategy, migrating 600+ pages and clarifying 1,000+ UI instructions. This overhaul eliminated fragmented user journeys and aligned the information architectures.
