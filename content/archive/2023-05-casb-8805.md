I unified 20+ pages for our Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)'s third-party SaaS integrations to follow a consistent information architecture. Previously, these pages were inconsistent in presenting how CASB scans for misconfigurations and security issues. This issue was especially critical for our Enterprise customers, who must implement CASB to meet compliance requirements. This docs update increased our ratings in Gartner and Forrester reviews and helped close a contract with a Fortune 500 customer.
