I led the effort to unify enterprise Zero Trust docs and product user experience. I implemented a data-driven IA strategy for 7-person writing team, migrating 600+ docs pages and clarifying 1,000+ UI instructions. This work improves the user experience by unifying the information architecture of our docs and our Cloudflare One products.
