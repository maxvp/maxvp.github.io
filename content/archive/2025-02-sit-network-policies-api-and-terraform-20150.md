Previously in the Gateway docs, we only provided UI examples for creating traffic policies. To fix this, I created a specification for representing API and Terraform policies in the docs, then led an effort to update our policy examples with API and Terraform options. This effort was especially important for our large Enterprise users, who need to automate policy creation and management.
