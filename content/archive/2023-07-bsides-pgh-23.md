I represented Cloudflare at the 2023 BSidesPGH information security conference in Pittsburgh, PA. Cloudflare sponsored the event and provided a booth for attendees to learn about our Zero Trust security products. While there, we conducted user experience surveys and collected information for potential participants in user research studies.
