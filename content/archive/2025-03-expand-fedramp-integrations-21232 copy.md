CASB expanded its integrations to support FedRAMP variants for ServiceNow, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365. To support this effort, I created documentation for these more secure variants according to the FedRAMP requirements. These changes directly correlated with an increase in performance ratings in the Gartner Magic Quadrant (MQ) survey.
