Final group project evaluating the user experience of the University of Pittsburgh School of Education [admissions site](https://www.education.pitt.edu/admissions/admissions). My team consulted with the Pitt School of Education's site team to identify pain points, ran research with potential users of the site, and presented final findings and recommendations to the client.
