Following the expiration of the global Cloudflare root certificate, the Gateway team implemented a new process that requires every Zero Trust user to generate and deploy a certificate unique to their account. I was responsible for change management in the docs, writing docs to describe the new process and clearly communicating to Enterprise users the changes that would occur upon certificate expiration.
