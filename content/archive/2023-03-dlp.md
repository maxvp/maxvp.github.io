I maintain the documentation for Cloudflare Data Loss Prevention (DLP). When we released predefined entries for DLP profiles (which adds the ability to detect known patterns in your Zero Trust organization's traffic, such as SSNs and credit card numbers), I restructured the DLP docs to follow a more logical workflow.
