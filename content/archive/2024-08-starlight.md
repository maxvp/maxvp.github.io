Acted as a technical lead in migrating the Cloudflare Developer Docs from legacy Hugo site framework to a modern [Starlight (Astro) framework](https://starlight.astro.build/). Made foundational IA decisions, updated global styling, and ported Hugo components to JSX to improve site performance and contributor experience.
