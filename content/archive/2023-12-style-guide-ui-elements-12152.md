Moved the internal wiki page describing our UI elements into the public-facing style guide.

Adapted the existing [Symbols in UI element names](https://developers.cloudflare.com/style-guide/formatting/symbols-in-ui-element-names/) page by moving each header down a level and creating a new section to accommodate general UI element concerns.
