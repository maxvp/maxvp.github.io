Using Cloudflare products including Workers AI and Browser Rendering, I created an AI tool that detects updates to the Cloudflare dashboard. When changes are detected, Frameflow automatically takes screenshots of the updated pages, analyzes them with an AI model, and submits a PR to GitHub to update the screenshot in the docs.
