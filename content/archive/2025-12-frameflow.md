Developed an automated screenshot maintenance tool using Cloudflare Workers AI, Browser Rendering, and Playwright. The tool identifies dashboard UI changes, captures updated screenshots and videos with an AI-driven detection model, and automatically submits GitHub pull requests to update documentation assets. This process drastically reduces manual content maintenance overhead.
