Cloudflare One dashboard users frequently complained that there was no centralized location to find information about all of the applications integrated with Zero Trust. To address this, the Cloudflare One Experiences team created the Application Library to provide a single point of reference for all of an organization's applications and their approval statuses. To provide guidance for integrating the Application Library into users' workflows, I led the documentation efforts for the Experiences team.
